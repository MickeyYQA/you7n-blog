by adding multiple suffixes.

##### Misc.

-   The letter \"j\" is only used in loanwords.
-   Words never begin with \"ğ\"
-   Look for common word endings. Tense changes in Turkish verbs are

    -   Possessivity/person: *-im* *-un* *-ın* *-in* *-iz* *-dur* *-tır*

        meaning \"to do\", *-mış* indicates the perfect tense, *-tır*
        indicates the third person (he/she/it).
    -   Example: Adalar, \"Islands\"; *Ada*
        is a noun meaning \"island\", *-lar* makes it plural.)
    -   Example: *Ev**imiz***, \"Our house\"; *Ev* is a noun meaning
        \"house\", *-im* indicates the first-person possessor, which
        *-iz* then makes plural.)

*ə*. This letter is not used in any other officially
recognized modern Latin alphabet. In addition, it uses the letters *x*
and *q*, which are not used in Turkish.

-   Common words: *və*, *ki*, *ilə*, *bu*, *o*, *isə*, *görə*, *da*,
    *də*

    *-dən*

## Chinese_language (汉语) {#chinese_中文}

    words.

    -   Serial comma 、(distinguished from the regular comma ，)
    -   Ellipse ...... (six dots)
-   No hiragana, katakana,
    or hangul
-   May be written vertically

### Simplified_Chinese (简体中文) vs Traditional_Chinese (繁体中文) {#simplified_chinese_简体_vs_traditional_chinese_繁體}

Note: Many characters were not simplified. As a result, it is common for
a short word or phrase to be identical between Simplified and
Traditional, but it is rare for an entire sentence to be identical as
well.

Common radicals different between Traditional and Simplified:

-   Simplified: 讠钅饣纟门(e.g.
    语 银 饭 纪 问)
-   Traditional: 訁釒飠糹門(e.g.
    語 銀 飯 紀 問)

Common characters different between Traditional and Simplified:

-   Simplified: 国 会 这 来 对 开 关 门 时 个 书 长 万 边 东 车 爱 儿
-   Traditional: 國 會 這 來 對 開 關 門 時 個 書 長 萬 邊
    東 車 愛 兒

### Standard written Chinese (based on Mandarin) vs written Vernacular Cantonese {#standard_written_chinese_based_on_mandarin_vs_written_vernacular_cantonese}

```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|zh:粵語}}
```
Note: Apart from Hong Kong, there are also Cantonese-speakers in
southern Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore[^1], so written
Cantonese can be written in either Simplified or Traditional characters.

Common characters in Vernacular Cantonese that do not occur or seldom
occur in Mandarin:

-   嘅 咗 咁 嚟 啲 唔 佢 乜 嘢 嗰 冇 睇

Some of the above characters are not supported in all character
encodings, so sometimes the 口 radical on the left is substituted with a
*0* or *o*, e.g.

-   o既 0既

Sometimes, different Chinese characters are used to express the same
meaning in Cantonese and Mandarin. If you use the one commonly used in
Cantonese to express the same meaning when you are speaking or writing
Mandarin, a native speaker may be confused or even find it difficult to
understand, and vice versa. Some examples are: (Cantonese vs Mandarin)

-   食vs吃(eat) 飲vs喝(drink) 企vs站(stand) 凍vs冷(cold)
    落vs下(down) 著vs穿(wear) 讀vs唸(read) 鬧vs罵(scold)
    計vs算(calculate) 咪vs別(do not) 行vs走(walk/go)
    先vs才(then)

There are Chinese words used to construct vocabularies used in Cantonese
that are not or seldomly implemented in modern Mandarin. Some examples
are: (Cantonese vs Mandarin)

-   成日vs整天(always) 傾計vs聊天(talk) 返工vs上班(go to
    work) 溫書vs溫習(study) 影片vs視頻(video) 隔離vs旁邊(nearby)
    起屋vs蓋樓(build a house) 聽日vs明天(tomorrow) 巴閉vs囂張(arrogant)
    搞掂vs完成(finished) 定係vs還是(or) 靚仔vs帥哥(handsome male)
    鍾意vs喜歡(like) 犀利vs厲害(powerful) 同埋vs和/及(and)
    黐綫vs瘋的(crazy) 雪櫃vs冰箱(fridge)

Cantonese vocabularies constructed by Cantonese words are used in daily
life in southern China and are not used in modern Mandarin. Some
examples are:

-   咪咁(don\'t be like this) 好冇(ok?) 玩嘢(to play
    tricks) 做嘢(to work) 睇戲(to watch a film/movie) 唔知(don\'t know)
    埋嚟(come) 嗰個(that) 咁嘅嘢(such thing) 佢哋(they) 咩事/乜事(what?)
    冇嘢(nothing) 嗰陣(at that moment) 越嚟越多(more and more)
    我嘅(mine) 梗係(of course) 𥄫(to peek) 冧佢(love him/her)
    拎畀我(take it to me) 嘥曬(everything is wasted) 你啱(you are right)
    𢫏住(to cover something) 冚唪唥(all) 撳實(to press something
    tightly) 瞓覺(to sleep) 掟石仔(to throw a tiny stone) 唓 (a modal
    word to express comtemption) 噃(a modal word for reminding or
    warning someone) 詏交(to argue) 好嬲(very angry) 心悒(feeling
    depressed in heart) 𧨾女仔(to please a girl) 得咁多咋(only this
    much) 做好咗(done something well)

Finally, when terms are introduced from other countries(especially the
US and the UK) to China, Cantonese and Mandarin often get different
translations, where Cantonese often translates according to
pronunciation of the terms in English and Mandarin often translates
according to the meaning of the terms. Some examples are: (Cantonese vs
Mandarin)

    according to the English pronunciation.) vs 出租車(chū zū chē,
    meaning cars for renting.), translated from Taxi.

    -   Period 。
    -   Comma 、(，also used in double byte)
    -   Quotation marks 「」

-   Double tick marks (known as daku-on) appearing at upper right of
    characters, eg. で　が　ず　デ　ガ　ズ

    ng = 성 song
-   Circles and ellipses are commonplace in Hangul; are exceedingly rare
    in Chinese.
-   General appearance has relatively-uniform complexity, as contrasted
    with Chinese or Japanese.

## Bengali

The Bengali alphabet or Bangla alphabet (Bengali: বাংলা বর্ণমালা, bangla
bôrnômala) or Bengali script (Bengali: বাংলা লিপি, bangla lipi) is the
writing system, originating in the Indian subcontinent, for the Bengali
language and is the fifth most widely used writing system in the world.
The script is used for other languages like Assamese, Maithili, Meithei
and Bishnupriya Manipuri, and has historically been used to write
Sanskrit within Bengal.

### Bengali {#bengali_1}

Bengali has unique 50 letter Alphabet.

-   The Bengali script has a total of 9 vowel graphemes, each of which
    is called a স্বরবর্ণ swôrôbôrnô \"vowel letter\". The swôrôbôrnôs
    represent six of the seven main vowel sounds of Bengali, along with
    two vowel diphthongs. All of them are used in both Bengali and
    Assamese languages.

অ আ ই ঈ উ ঊ ঋ এ ঐ ও ঔ

-   The Bengali script has a total of 39 Consonants. Consonant letters
    are called ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ bænjônbôrnô \"consonant letter\" in Bengali. The
    names of the letters are typically just the consonant sound plus the
    inherent vowel অ ô. Since the inherent vowel is assumed and not
    written, most letters\' names look identical to the letter itself
    (the name of the letter ঘ is itself ghô, not gh).

ক খ গ ঘ ঙ চ ছ জ ঝ ঞ ট ঠ ড ঢ ণ ত থ দ ধ ন প ফ ব ভ ম য র ল শ ষ স হ ড় ঢ় য় ৎ
ঃ ং ঁ

-   has 10 diacritics denoting syllable rhymes -

া ি ী ু ূ ৃ ে ৈ ো ৌ

### Assamese

-   The Assamese script has a total of 9 vowel graphemes, each of which
    is called a স্বরবর্ণ swôrôbôrnô \"vowel letter\" too.

অ আ ই ঈ উ ঊ ঋ এ ঐ ও ঔ

-   has a total of 39 Consonants. Consonant letters are called ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ
    bænjônbôrnô \"consonant letter\" in Bengali.

ক খ গ ঘ ঙ চ ছ জ ঝ ঞ ট ঠ ড ঢ ণ ত থ দ ধ ন প ফ ব ভ ম য ৰ ল শ ষ স হ ড় ঢ় য় ৎ
ঃ ং ঁ

-   has 10 diacritics denoting syllable rhymes -

া ি ী ু ূ ৃ ে ৈ ো ৌ

## Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics {#canadian_aboriginal_syllabics}

In modern writing, Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics are indicative of
Cree_language,
Inuktitut, or
Ojibwe_language, though the latter two are also
written in alternative scripts. The basic glyph set is ᐁ ᐱ ᑌ ᑫ ᒉ ᒣ ᓀ ᓭ
ᔦ, each of which may appear in any of four orientations, boldfaced,
superscripted, and with diacritics including ᑊ ᐟ ᐠ ᐨ ᒼ ᐣ ᐢ ᐧ ᐤ ᐦ ᕽ ᓫ ᕑ.
This abugida has also been used for
Blackfoot_language.

### Klingon_language (tlhIngan_Hol) {#klingon_tlhingan_hol}

-   When written in the Latin alphabet Klingon has the unusual property
    of a distinction in case; *q* and *Q* are different letters, and
    other letters are either always (e.g. D, I, S) or never (e.g. ch,
    tlh, v) written in upper case. This causes a large number of words
    that look quite strange to people who aren\'t used to it, for
    example: *yIDoghQo{{\'}}*, *tlhIngan Hol* (with mixed case).
-   The apostrophe is fairly frequent, especially at the end of a word
    or syllable.
-   Common suffixes: *-be\', -\'a{{\'}}*

    *pi\'o* etc.;
-   usually no punctuation except for dots;
-   may use commas in the middle of words (typically proper nouns).

### Toki_Pona (toki_pona) {#toki_pona_toki_pona}

-   alphabet is all lowercase except loanwords
-   no diacritics
-   only uses Voice in writing, e.g.
    *p*, *t*, *k*

Full alphabet: p, t, k, s, m, n, l, j, w, a, e, i, o, u

-   common words *li*, *mi*, *e*, *sina*, *ona*, *jan*
-   often sounds like a simplified and phonetic form of English or
    Swedish
-   many two-syllable words
